# Agentic Coding: Building Features with AI Teammates

ConFoo 2026 · Montreal · February 27, 2026

Slides for Rida Al Barazi's second ConFoo 2026 talk.

**Companion to:** [Safe Agentic Dev Environments](https://confoo.ca/en/2026/session/safe-agentic-dev-environments)

## Synopsis

Coding Agents succeed when you give them structure. This session runs like a workshop: we'll demonstrate how to build a feature with coding agents by defining a spec, managing context, and breaking the work into smaller subtasks. Along the way, you'll see real prompts, failure cases, and handoff rhythms that keep quality high while boosting delivery speed.
